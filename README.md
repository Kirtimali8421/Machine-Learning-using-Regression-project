🌾 Predicting Crop Yield and Diseases using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques to help farmers and agricultural experts predict crop yield and detect potential diseases early, enabling smarter decision-making and improved food security.

🔍 Project Objectives

Predict crop yield based on environmental, soil, and crop data (Regression)

Detect plant diseases from symptoms or images (Classification)

Build a clean, interactive ML pipeline

Deploy models using Streamlit for easy access


🛠 Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Streamlit (for web app interface)

Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, etc.


📊 Key Features

Cleaned dataset with EDA

Crop yield prediction using regression models

Disease detection using classification models

R² score, accuracy, precision-recall used for evaluation

User-friendly interface for input and predictions
